- Interactive visual tracking exercise
- Real-time device orientation feedback
- Stability score monitoring
- Customizable exercise duration
- Haptic feedback for enhanced user experience

### 2. Breathing Exercise
- Three intensity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe)
- Guided breathing patterns with visual cues
- Progress tracking
- Customizable session lengths
- Session history recording

### 3. P6 Acupressure Guide
- Step-by-step instructions
- Research-backed information
- Expert tips and techniques
- Visual demonstrations
- Comprehensive guidance for optimal results

## Technical Requirements

- iOS 16.0 or later
- Compatible with iPhone and iPad
- Supports both portrait and landscape orientations
- Requires device motion and haptic feedback capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run using iOS 16.0 or later simulator/device

## How It Works

### Horizon Gazing
The app uses CoreMotion to track device orientation and provides a visual focus point that users need to maintain within a target zone. This helps stabilize the visual system and reduce motion sickness symptoms.

### Breathing Exercise
Implements a structured breathing pattern:
- Inhale (4 seconds)
- Hold (7 seconds)
- Exhale (8 seconds)
- Rest (2 seconds)

### P6 Acupressure
Provides detailed guidance for locating and applying pressure to the P6 (Nei Guan) point, known for its effectiveness in reducing motion sickness symptoms.
